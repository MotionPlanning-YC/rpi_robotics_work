Schunk Powerball LWA 4.6 Robotic Arm
------------------------------------

Overview
--------
The Schunk Powerball LWA (Light Weight Arm) 4.6 is a 6 Degree-of-Freedom spherical wrist robotic arm.  
Unfortunately, software from the Schunk company has not been maintained, so this Wiki article will facilitate
in installing, using, and developing new software for the Powerball.

Hardware Overview
-----------------
The Powerball has 6 joints; each of the silver balls on the Powerball contains 2 joints (see Figure 1).  

Software Overview
-----------------
The current software stack on the Powerball is running on Ubuntu 12.04 Linux. The backend code is written by
Neil Dantam from Georgia Tech (please see https://github.com/golems for GA Tech's code).  ROS was deemed too slow
to effectively run the Powerball; the bottleneck lies in "roscore", since all messages have to pass through the 
roscore node to reach their destination.  As a result, Neil developed the following software for the Powerball:

ACH
---
ACH is a library and set of utilities that acts as a replacement for ROS. This software performs high-performance
Interprocess Communication (IPC), much like how ROS utilizes subscribers and publishers to send messages between nodes.

SNS
---
SNS provides the message definitions of messages that can be sent through ACH.  This is the equivalent of the standard
messages library in ROS "std_msgs".

Socanmatic
----------
This is the a SocketCAN Device Driver that allows the Powerball computer to communicate with the Powerball.  Please
see the section titled "SocketCan Device Driver" for more information.

Reflex
------
Reflex is a set of libraries to help plan trajectory motions for the Powerball.

Software Prerequisites:
-----------------------
You will need the following packages BEFORE installing GA Tech's software:

sudo apt-get install gfortran build-essential autoconf automake libtool autoconf-archive autotools-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev
