Description: Realtime message bus IPC library, development files
 Ach is a new Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism and
 library. It is uniquely suited for coordinating perception, control
 drivers, and algorithms in real-time systems that sample data from
 physical processes. Ach eliminates the Head-of-Line Blocking problem
 for applications that always require access to the newest
 message. Ach is efficient, robust, and formally verified. It has been
 tested and demonstrated on a variety of physical robotic
 systems. Finally, the source code for Ach is available under an Open
 Source BSD-style license.
