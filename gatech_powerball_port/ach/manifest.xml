<!-- ROS Manifest for Ach IPC Library -->

<package>
  <description brief="IPC for Real-Time Robot Control">
    Ach is an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism and
    library. It is uniquely suited for coordinating perception,
    control drivers, and algorithms in real-time systems that sample
    data from physical processes. Ach eliminates the Head-of-Line
    Blocking problem for applications that always require access to
    the newest message. Ach is efficient, robust, and formally
    verified. It has been tested and demonstrated on a variety of
    physical robotic systems. Finally, the source code for Ach is
    available under an Open Source BSD-style license.
