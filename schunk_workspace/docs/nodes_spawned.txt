These are the ROS nodes that are spawned when executing

"roslaunch schunk_lwa4p lwa4p.launch"   

- Since roslaunch doesn't spawn nodes in sequential order, ordering does not matter here.   

1)  robot_state_publisher (http://wiki.ros.org/robot_state_publisher)
	- type state_publisher
	- This node publishes the joint state of the Powerball via the Transforms Tf library 

2) arm_controller 

3) Trajectory Controller is located in:
cob_trajectory_controller/genericArmCtrl.h

Rostopics:
----------

/joint_states
	- gives time stamp in seconds, nanoseconds 
	- joint positions in radians
	- joint velocities
	- joint efforts (all 0.0?)

/arm_controller/command_vel
	- gives the velocity sent to each joint in radians/second  

/arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/goal
	- sets the goal for the 

Cob Command GUI
---------------
- started by calling
	roslaunch schunk_lwa4p dashboard.launch

- 1 ROS parameter added: config/command_gui_buttons.yaml
	- passed in as a parameter in the control_buttons namespace  

- Joint Configurations are stored in config/joint_configurations.yaml
	- includes definitions for
		- waveleft, waveright, folded, home 

- config/command_gui_buttons.yaml stores groups for:
	- arm_settings, arm positions, and arm trajectories
